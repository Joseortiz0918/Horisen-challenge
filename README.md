# Horisen clean up

## Description
This project was made to clean up the CSS style sheet and to implement HTML semantics to increase Horisenâ€™s web page search engine optimization. This project was done to make sure the website follows accessibility standards. By changing basic dividers like div to more specific dividers like article and section and adding on alternative descriptions to all images, makes sure that this website is more optimized for screen readers and boosts accessibility.

## Usage
As a company in this age having a website following common accessibility practices is one of the best ways to boost SEO. This website now uses more specific dividers and descriptions to all images to help screen readers and in turn makes this website available to those with vision impairments. During this project I also decided to simplify the css style sheet to reduce redundancy within the code. I also noticed that a title was not added and fixed a link within the nav bar. I added a screenshot and link to the working website.
